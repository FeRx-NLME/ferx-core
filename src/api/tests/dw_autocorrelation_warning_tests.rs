//! Exactly what the pooled-IWRES autocorrelation warning says (#1285, #1350
//! row 10a).
//!
//! The assertions are **exact string equality**, not `contains`. The sentence
//! removed in this change — `" For ODE models, SDE process noise may also
//! help."` — is a recommendation, so a `!msg.contains("SDE")` assertion would
//! pass on any rewording that still sends the user into `[diffusion]` for
//! residual autocorrelation, which the EKF cannot supply while it never
//! corrects the state mean with the observed data. Nothing tested the suffix at
//! all, which is how it outlived the filing of #1285.
//!
//! Classification is *not* re-asserted here: `crate::types::classify_warning`
//! keys on "autocorrelation" / "durbin", and `types_tests.rs` already pins both
//! of these messages to the `dw_autocorrelation` category. A second copy of
//! that assertion here would cover for the first one.
